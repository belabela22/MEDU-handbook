      <h2>ü©∫ Section 5: Weekly Task Quota</h2>
      <p>In order to develop the very vast department of medical education, it is crucial that everyone in our team contributes. The following tasks listed will be our main focuses:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Task 1: Trivia Cards</strong><br />
          Your assignment this week is to make 10 detailed trivia cards. They do not have to be a specific specialty, so you may choose that on your own. They must have 10 questions, and an answer guide for whoever chooses to use them. They may be used for trivia night, so make sure they are neat and presentable.</li>

        <li><strong>Task 2: Research Projects</strong><br />
          Members will be asked to do research on a topic that they desire and then create a guide about the topic along with a quiz and or guide. You can use Canva or Google Docs, and if you have any other website you would like to use, reach out to the Overseers!</li>

        <li><strong>Task 3: Ethical Case Discussion</strong><br />
          Members will be asked to get into groups of two. They will create a group name and be added into a ticket. One of the overseers will provide a realistic and real-life study. They will be asked to try and solve the case. This task develops critical thinking and ethical reasoning skills in a supportive environment. This will be a fun and competitive task against their peers. You and your partner will be expected to complete this in a timely manner, and to work together! If there is any issues with this feel free to contact me or Midnight, and it will be solved!</li>

        <li><strong>Task 4: Advanced Research Methodology</strong><br />
          Members will be asked to research on a topic/specialty that they are not familiar with and will be required to do qualitative research, biostatistics, and grant writing. The goal for this task is to equip members with the skills needed to conduct high-quality research and secure funding. You will each be assigned your topic, when you are assigned this task! Which means you are expected to ping either me or Midnight, to get assigned a research topic!</li>

        <li><strong>Task 5: Advanced Case Study</strong><br />
          Create realistic and detailed case studies on various medical conditions, incorporating real-world scenarios, patient histories, and treatment plans. If you need to use any resources, please list them in your document. If you need a format, feel free to ping me and I can provide one!</li>

        <li><strong>Task 6: Detailed Staff Report</strong><br />
          Staff reviews will be frequent. As you moderate the server, you will make an effort to write a report about a player. This report will include the date, the type of case, specialty, and an overall summary of their performance. This will be used to assess which players should be rewarded, and which players deserve demotion. This requires you to be in-game, in order to observe cases. It should be strictly medical wise, only. You can choose any case you would like, and then write your report on it.</li>

        <li><strong>Task 7: Continuous Professional Development</strong><br />
          Create a series of CPD courses for practicing clinicians, focusing on emerging medical knowledge, new treatment protocols, and ongoing skill development. This will ensure that healthcare providers stay current with the latest updates in medicine throughout their careers. CPD: Continuous professional development (CPD) is a process that helps professionals maintain and improve their skills, knowledge, and experience. It involves tracking and documenting what professionals learn and experience both formally and informally, and then applying that knowledge. CPD can help professionals feel more competent, advance their careers, etc.</li>

      <h2>üìò Section 6: Monthly Task Quota</h2>
      <p>A members monthly quota will consist of 1 training and 1 guide. It is required and it is the members‚Äô responsibility to get their monthly quota done. The members will get reminders of their monthly quota. The monthly quota may vary.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="section7" tabindex="0">
      <h2>‚öïÔ∏è Section 7: Shifts & Activity</h2>
      <p>Members of the Medical Education Department are highly encouraged to be active as much as possible. The rule of the monthly quota set by the ownership department continues to apply.</p>

      <p>Failure to remain an active member and contributor of the ME department will result in a demotional warning that can lead to complete expulsion in the department. Weekly reviews and tasks are especially crucial and will reflect your activity. Those on leave of absence are exempt from this policy. I understand that everyone must be involved in a life beyond this department, therefore, if things get complicated, you are strongly urged to reach out to your overseer or ownership representative. We can work out a compromise that will not be used against you.</p>

      <p>Shifts and activity will be analyzed by the Medical Education Coordinator. The activity section of this document will mainly cover the trainings given by this department. Our Medical Educator Interns are required to participate in the mandatory training, created and hosted by the Medical Educations Executive Council.</p>

      <p>As part of the MEDU Department, you are expected to remain active in the MEDU Department. Failure to remain active can result in the usage of the 3 Department Strike Policy. A quota will regard the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Hosting minimum of 2 trainings per week. (Every week resets)</li>
        <li>Claim at least 1 ticket per week (Junior trainer)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>ü©∫ Section 8: Tutoring Support & Education</h2>
      <p>As mentioned in the previous pages, we have multiple services that will serve as an educational support system for SWM staff. Any and all tutoring will need to be fact checked by credible and relevant sources. There is an understanding that majority, if not all, of us are not certified medical professionals. Therefore, we must best deal with the resources we have, but aim to remain a professional and factually accurate department.</p>

      <p>Our major tutoring sources will include in-game trainings, discord ticket trainings, and optional one-on-one Q&A‚Äôs VIA a discord ticket system. We will also be utilizing and managing the medical notes channel/forum.</p>

      <p>Trainings will need to be created and will be stored on the community trello, in order to eliminate confusions during trainings. This will enable easy copy and paste trainings.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="section9" tabindex="0">
      <h2>üìò Section 9: Training blueprints and guide regulations</h2>
      <p>‚Ü™ PTS (Permission to Speak) will remain active during trainings. Educators are required to answer any questions trainees have to their best ability. Failure of trainees to remain in PTS will result in a warning, and the second failure will result in a kick from the training.</p>
      <p>‚Ü™ Trolling in a ticket is strictly prohibited. If you identify trolling inside of a training session, it will be an immediate kick from the training.</p>
      <p>‚Ü™ Trainings will be consistently interactive. Following this rule, trainees must remain active during the session. Failure to remain active will result in an kick from the training. However, if a trainee notifies prior to inactivity, exceptions may be made.</p>

      <p>Trainings are followed by a guide previously made. You may spectate an overseer or a peer to get more information on trainings and how they work.</p>

      <p>If you have any questions about trainings, you may ask an overseer.</p>

      <p>When hosting a training, you must follow this script (link below).<br />

      <p>In order to advance from a Medical Educator Intern ‚Üí Medical Educator, you must complete your MEDU internship. The internship has 2 components. The first section will be a mandatory training. This training will cover the following:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Any information in the handbook</li>
        <li>Training manners and professionalism</li>
        <li>How to find reliable sources (I will also offer some great resources!)</li>
        <li>Common FAQs!</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The second part of the internship will be the final task. This final task may be submitted after your training. The final task will be to create TWO training guides/lectures on a topic of your choice. Some common examples include: IV set-up, arterial lines, bedside manner, or a procedure/disease of your choice.</p>

      <p>Passing both the training and the final task will allow you to further get promoted. Failure to complete these trainings will prohibit you from getting promoted within the MEDU department.</p>

      <h3>What happens if I fail my training/final task?</h3>
      <p>Failure of the first training will require you to wait 5 days before re-doing this process. During these 5 days, it is highly recommended to review your failed work and see what you could do differently. Failure of this process the second time will result in demotion/expulsion from the department.</p>
